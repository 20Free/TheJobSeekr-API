Two of our cofounders are designers, and an appreciation of the power of design is in everything we do. Even our internal dashboards have great typography. We believe design is as much about behaviour and emotion as it is about utility and ease. We are a broad team that contributes to product direction and crafts pixel-perfect output. Situated with the engineering team, we move quickly but also have enough time and space to create broad, innovative ideas. We love simplicity and a sense of whimsy. Sound like your type of space?

With 300M+ guest check-ins over the last ten years, we're constantly taking on challenges in search algorithms, payments, fraud prevention, and growth — all while maintaining a beautiful user experience.  We want to build solutions to these problems that are scalable, performant, and elegant, and we're looking for talented people to help us do just that.\n        \n\n      \n\n    \n\n\n    \n      \n        \n          \n        \n\n      \n\n      \n        \n          \n        \n\n      \n\n      \n        \n          \n        \n\n      \n\n    \n\n\n    \n      \n        \n          Move Fast\n        \n\n        \n          Every engineer deploys on their first day — and every day after that too. We use Amazon Web Services and practice continuous deployment so we can quickly try out new ideas and iterate on existing product features, and we love experimenting with new technology if it's right for the job.  Not only do we ride the cutting edge, we make it: we've open sourced Aerosolve a machine learning package built for humans, and Apache Airflow (incubating) to author workflows as directed acyclic graphs of tasks, amongst other projects.

All of our engineers hang out in chat rooms so that we can keep informal knowledge sharing flowing — and because coding is more fun when you do it together.  We host regular tech talks, both internal and external, so that everyone gets a chance to become the best at their craft.\n        \n\n      \n\n    \n\n\n    \n      \n        \n          \n        \n\n      \n\n      \n        \n          \n        \n\n      \n\n    \n\n\n    \n      \n        \n          Craftsmanship\n        \n\n        \n          For us, engineering isn’t just a job but a practice that we want to perfect. We aim to keep our systems modular, our code clean, and our documentation clear, and we follow the idea of leaving things better than how you found it. It’s not just about the code — putting the right processes and tools in place to make developers happy and efficient is important to us because it gives us the time to focus on polishing the

Each day we collect and remit payments to 190+ countries in over 70 currencies and counting. Currently, no solution exists with the global reach we require, so we build and maintain our own global payments infrastructure.\n\nWe operate at all levels of the stack: we’re responsible for the UIs that allow people all over the world to pay and get paid in their locally preferred methods, the APIs and processor integrations to send payment instructions to our wide network of partners, the offline reporting and reconciliation pipelines that ensure financial data integrity and allow the business to operate, and more.\n\nFrom high-throughput Java services, to Ruby user-facing applications, to data pipelines utilizing Scala/Spark, to mobile (iOS/Android) payment flows, to rich client-side applications using ReactJS, we emphasize reliability, testability, quality, and solid engineering design.\n\nMeet the people, learn about the challenges, and read more about what we do at Payments here.\n\nWhat are examples of work that Payment engineers have done at Airbnb?\n\n\tOur payments platform transmits billions of dollars per year in dozens of different currencies across almost every country in the world. By integrating new partners, we can both optimize our costs and grow our business by better supporting different countries. Our recent integrations have opened up payments in Brazil and Cuba.\n\tWe take security very seriously and work on a variety of security initiatives including data encryption and building and maintaining PCI compliant systems.\n\tHandling taxes in our booking application is a big part of supporting guests, hosts and our communities. We build tools to make the experience as magical as possible, which poses many challenges due to its inherent complexity and global scope in our two sided marketplace.\n\tScaling our systems is becoming increasingly challenging given the sheer volume of transactions, currencies, and payment methods we support. Recently we migrated from batch processing to a real-time, streaming model using asynchronous queues and horizontally scalable workers, and many more projects like this are in the pipeline.\n\tWe’ve built our own data warehouse to facilitate reliable, time series based GAAP compliant reporting for finance and accounting. Moreover, we efficiently reconcile every transaction we process to make sure our system is in sync with banks all over the world.\n\n\nBlog posts from our team:\n\n\tTech Talk: Payments at Airbnb\n\tTesting at Airbnb\n\tAnomaly Detection for Airbnb's Payment Platform\n\tMaintaining Quality at Scale\n\tSecret Ingredients to building Airbnb's Payments Platform\n\tOpen Air Tech Talk: Payments on a Global Scale\n\tLarge Scale Payment Systems and Ruby on Rails\n\tInterning with the Airbnb Payments Team\n\n\nThe following experience is relevant to us:\n\n\tComfort working in different parts of the stack\n\tExperience with relational databases and schema design\n\tInterest in innovations within the global payments industry\n\tRigor in automated testing, code quality, and engineering best practices\n\tBonus: Experience with financial, accounting or payments systems\n\tBonus: Experience scaling architecture\n\tBonus: Experience working with large and complex datasets\n\tBonus: Proficiency with Ruby, Java, and/or Scala\n\tBonus: Experience with Spark and/or other distributed data processing systems\n\n\nBenefits:\n\n\tStock\n\tCompetitive salaries\n\tQuarterly employee travel coupon\n\tPaid time off\n\tMedical, dental, & vision insurance\n\tLife insurance and disability benefits\n\tFitness Discounts\n\t401K\n\tFlexible Spending Accounts\n\tApple equipment\n\tCommuter Subsidies\n\tCommunity Involvement (4 hours per month to give back to the community)\n\tCompany sponsored tech talks and happy hours\n\tMuch more...\n\n\n\n          \n            Apply Now\n          \n        \n\n      \n\n      \n        \n          \t\n                Tweet\n              \n\t\n              \n            \n\t\n                \n\n              \n\t\n                \n\n              \n\n\n        \n\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n          \n\tTerms\n\tPrivacy\n\tSite Map\n\tAirbnbmag"

No other travel service participates so broadly in the travel experience from discovery, to booking, to crafting experiences during the stay, and assessing quality of trips. This gives us an incredibly rich dataset to collect, transform, and analyze in order to improve the effectiveness of our marketplace and create delight for guests and hosts.\n\nWe leverage existing open source technologies like Kafka, Hadoop, Hive, Presto, Spark, and also write our own. Many projects listed below have been open sourced. As a member of our team you would spend time designing and growing our existing infrastructure, democratizing data access at the company, and promoting the correct use of data and analytics at the company.\n\nWhat are examples of work that Data Platform Engineers have done at Airbnb?\n\n\tReal-time streaming infrastructure: To enable teams to move quickly, getting accurate data with minimal delay is a core focus in DI. Currently, we are building out Spark-based infrastructure to allow for easy development of streaming applications.\n\tInteractive dimensional analysis: Data scientists have a strong need to query data and compute aggregates on various dimensional cuts. To address this, we are building a query tool based on Druid to allow users to interactively slice-and-dice large datasets.\n\tCluster management systems: To help manage multiple petabyte-scale clusters, easy-to-use systems to handle security, disaster recovery, and replication are in development. For replication, we have developed and open sourced ReAir \n\tData workflow management: Started at Airbnb, Airflow is a system that enables users to schedule data-related workflows with a code-as-configuration model and web front end.\n\tMachine learning infrastructure: Many products at Airbnb rely on machine learning (ML) to achieve their goals. A common infrastructure for ML can save significant development time for the company.\n\n\nThe following experience is relevant to us:\n\n\t2+ years of full-time, industry experience\n\tWorking with data at the petabyte scale\n\tDesign and operation of robust distributed systems\n\tExperience with Java / Scala is preferred\n\tStrong scripting ability in Ruby / Python / Bash\n\tWorking knowledge of relational databases and query authoring (SQL)\n\tLove to use and develop open source technologies like Kafka, Hadoop, Hive, Presto, and Spark\n\tRigor in high code quality, automated testing, and other engineering best practices\n\tBS/MS/PhD in Computer Science or a related field (ideal)\n\n\nBenefits\n\n\tStock\n\tCompetitive salaries\n\tQuarterly employee travel coupon\n\tPaid time off\n\tMedical, dental, & vision insurance\n\tLife insurance and disability benefits\n\tFitness Discounts\n\t401K\n\tFlexible Spending Accounts\n\tApple equipment\n\tCommuter Subsidies\n\tCommunity Involvement (4 hours per month to give back to the community)\n\tCompany sponsored tech talks and happy hours\n\tMuch more...\n\n\n\n          \n            Apply Now\n          \n        \n\n      \n\n      \n        \n          \t\n                Tweet\n              \n\t\n              \n            \n\t\n                \n\n              \n\t\n                \n\n              \n\n\n        \n\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n          \n\tTerms\n\tPrivacy\n\tSite Map\n\tAirbnbmag"

You will also develop and refine processes, plans and procedures and partner closely with Legal, Comms and other stakeholders across the business.\n\n\n\tRed Teaming: The team will run red teams (attack simulations) to measure our ability to prevent, detect and respond to real-world attacks. You will identify areas for improvement in people, process and technology and prioritize these efforts, collaborating with stakeholders.\n\n\nHow We Are Different:\n\n\tThreat Intelligence: Instead of solely relying on atomic indicators (MD5, IP, Domain), we translate raw intelligence from public and commercial threat reports into actionable detection rules that focus on TTPs. We utilize MITRE’s ATT&CK framework to reason about breadth, depth and areas for improvement. We carefully reason about what we are uniquely positioned to do and where we can leverage industry partners and vendors.\n\n\n\n\tSecurity Operations: We have all seen bad SOCs: large numbers of analysts, hundreds to thousands of alerts, IT environment centric (production is ignored), heavy emphasis on network logs and appliances, repetitive work, and limited autonomy and career progression. Our team focuses on automation, high fidelity rules w/tests and autonomy of the entire lifecycle: intelligence -> rule development -> deployment -> triage -> incident response. You won’t find an alert queue with hundreds of low fidelity alerts here. Rules include enough context so a majority of them can be triaged via a mobile application.\n\n\n\n\tIncident Response: You are expected to drive incidents to resolution quickly through pre-deployed infrastructure, products, automation and playbooks, not one-off manual SIEM queries.\n\n\n\tRedteaming: We know the difference between a pentest and a redteam. Using existing trust and rapport the team has already developed, you will challenge existing assumptions, technologies and processes and identify ways to improve Airbnb’s security posture. \n\tScope: You are responsible for all corporate and production environments, which includes Windows, macOS & Linux systems, supporting networks, applications, and all therein.\n\tQuality: You will see it in our blog posts and our open source projects: we care a lot about quality. We expect you will meet or raise this bar.\n\n\nRelevant Experience: \n\n\tYou are able to solve large, complex technical problems\n\tYou have multiple years of experience in detecting and responding to attacks.\n\tYou are comfortable and experienced in managing significant incidents including technical response, coordination, and communicating with stakeholders across functions (Executives, Legal, etc.)\n\tYou are self-driven, autonomous and can contribute to the strategy and roadmap of the team\n\tYou have experience in technical mentorship and enjoy collaborating with teammates and industry peers\n\tYou can code in Python and are capable of contributing meaningful rules to StreamAlert\n\tYou can write effective YARA rules and are capable of contributing meaningful rules to BinaryAlert\n\tYou have an attention to detail and care about quality and testing\n\tYou have excellent written and verbal communication skills; people are delighted when they read your blog posts, threat reports and/or postmortems\n\n\nBenefits:\n\n\tStock\n\tCompetitive salaries\n\tQuarterly employee travel coupon\n\tPaid time off\n\tMedical, dental, & vision insurance\n\tLife insurance and disability benefits\n\tFitness Discounts\n\t401K\n\tFlexible Spending Accounts\n\tApple equipment\n\tCommuter Subsidies\n\tCommunity Involvement (4 hours per month to give back to the community)\n\tCompany sponsored tech talks and happy hours\n\tMuch more...\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n            Apply Now\n          \n        \n\n      \n\n      \n        \n          \t\n                Tweet\n              \n\t\n              \n            \n\t\n                \n\n              \n\t\n                \n\n              \n\n\n        \n\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n          \n\tTerms\n\tPrivacy\n\tSite Map\n\tAirbnbmag"

The tricky thing is, most of us haven’t been to Cuba, so we try to come up with creative ways to help people find the experience they’re looking for in places they may have never been.  The data science team works in tandem with product management, engineering, and design teams to solve for things like this. \n\nOur inference data scientists are deep in understanding the complications of running experiments in a two-sided marketplace, power analysis and stopping criterions, and statistical models to improve power/significance. Another interesting problem space is understanding what to do when we are unable to conduct experiments. How do we understand the impact of something new?\n\nWe are looking for Data Scientist intern to join our team and expand upon the work we have done.

Thank you. \n\nAbout Airbnb\n\nAirbnb’s mission is to connect people to unique travel experiences, in more than 34,000 cities and 190 Countries.   We are making it possible for hosts to supplement their income while helping visitors from around the world experience neighborhoods and communities outside traditional tourist zones.\n\nHere at Airbnb, we’re big fans of travel. We love thinking about the diversity of experiences our host community offers, and we spend a fair amount of time trying to make sense of the tens of thousands of cities where people are booking trips every night. The tricky thing is, most of us haven’t been to Cuba, so we try to come up with creative ways to help people find the experience they’re looking for in places they may have never been.  The data science team works in tandem with product management, engineering, and design teams to solve for things like this. \n\nSkills and Qualifications:\n\n\tStrong analytical fundamentals: Pursuing a PhD or MS in CS, Math, Statistics, Physics, Economics or other quantitative field with an expected graduation date latest of Summer 2019.\n\tPreferred fields of study are statistics, math, economics, or related discipline.\n\tTools: Experience using R, Python, and/or SQL.\n\tProduct sense: Ability to connect your analysis to real world phenomena, always thinking about how insights from the data can be used to improve Airbnb.\n\tCommunication: Demonstrated ability to distill and share complex technical concepts to a less technical audience.  \n\n\nBenefits: \n\n\tStock\n\t$2,000 yearly employee travel coupon\n\tCompetitive salary\n\tPaid time off \n\tMedical, dental, & vision insurance\n\tLife & disability coverage\n\t401K\n\tFlexible Spending Accounts\n\tApple equipment\n\tDaily breakfast, lunch, and dinner\n\n\n\n          \n            Apply Now\n          \n        \n\n      \n\n      \n        \n          \t\n                Tweet\n              \n\t\n              \n            \n\t\n                \n\n              \n\t\n                \n\n              \n\n\n        \n\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n          \n\tTerms\n\tPrivacy\n\tSite Map\n\tAirbnbmag"

We are growing our team and looking for talented engineers to join us in building the technology solutions that will help us scale Airbnb Plus to include millions of new homes. We operate at all levels of the stack: we’re responsible for the products that empower hosts to meet a higher standard of quality and design and grow their business through Airbnb and to attract a larger number of travelers to use Airbnb for the first time. The team focuses on providing a seamless end-to-end experience for our Plus hosts and guests. From high-throughput Java services, to Ruby user-facing applications, to mobile (iOS/Android) flows, to rich client-side applications using ReactJS, to data pipelines, to machine learning, we emphasize reliability, testability, quality, and solid engineering design.\n\nLike all teams at Airbnb, we value and promote the diversity of our workforce, our guests, our hosts, our marketplace platform, and the world. Simply put, diversity belongs.\n\nWhat is Frontend at Airbnb?\n\nFrontend Engineers are an essential part of our team. FEs work closely with world class product managers, designers, and data scientists. We rely and (and build on!) cutting edge tooling such as Apollo/GraphQL and deliver a strongly-typed UI using TypeScript. We build libraries and abstractions to make our lives easier, such as Design Language System (DLS), our front-end toolkit, which helps ensure our product looks and works great everywhere from a Cinema Display with a fiber connection down to a cheap phone with a shaky 3G connection.\n\nProjects:\n\n\n\tPlus HQ: We verify homes for quality, comfort, and style. The vetting process is complicated and requires much back and forth with the host. In Plus HQ projects, we are building a go-to place for our hosts to view their onboarding status, action items, next steps. This would enable us to provide them with educational content and help them throughout the process. When they become Plus hosts, they can use Plus HQ to see their performance and earnings.\n\tValue to hosts: We’re constantly thinking of how to surface useful information to hosts to help them understand and maximize the value of being a Plus host. This consists of personalizing content and building applications that allow us contact house through various mediums. \n\tAssessment tools: We’re building a world class set of tools that will enable Plus to grow 10x. Our discussions are focused around impact and doing right by our customers in the both the short term (next day) and long term (next year). \n\tFix it Flow: This service is part chat, part verification, part task queue and enables Airbnb and hosts to work together to improve their home to meet Airbnb Plus standards. We’re experimenting with wild and impactful ideas, such as helping hosts up-level their homes with recommendations and cash incentives.\n\n\n\n \n\n\tGuest experience: To help users further understand the value of Plus, we need to educate them about Plus throughout our guest search experience. Over the coming quarters, we are investing significantly in our front end to showcase Plus homes. This includes introducing meaningful changes to our search, display, and booking experiences. \n\n\n \n\nMinimum Requirements:\n\n\t2+ years industry experience\n\tBachelor’s and/or Master’s degree, preferably in CS, or equivalent experience\n\tComfortable coding in JavaScript\n\tExperience with modern JavaScript libraries and tooling (e.g. React)\n\tFluency in HTML, CSS, and related web technologies\n\tDemonstrated knowledge of Computer Science fundamentals\n\tAwareness of cross-browser compatibility issues and client-side performance considerations\n\tDemonstrated design and UX sensibilities\n\n\nAdditional requirements/responsibilities:\n\n\tDrive the future of Frontend products in the industry and create world class performance for all of Airbnb’s products \n\tCollaborate with Product Managers and Experience Designers to iterate on the design and implementation of our product\n\tWork with Data Scientists and Backend Engineers to build features and ship experiments\n\tBuild efficient and reusable front-end systems and abstractions\n\tFind and address performance issues\n\tParticipate in design and code reviews\n\tIdentify and communicate front-end best practices\n\n\nRelevant Links:\n\n\tCarol, one of our Plus engineering managers, was named one of the most powerful female engineers of 2018 by Business Insider.\n\tRearchitecting Airbnb’s Frontend\n\tTechTalk: GraphQL and Appollo at Airbnb\n\tOperationalizing Node.js for Server Side Rendering\n\tReconciling GraphQL and Thrift at Airbnb\n\tMoving Airbnb Search to React\n\n\nBenefits:\n\n\tStock\n\tCompetitive salaries\n\tQuarterly employee travel coupon\n\tPaid time off\n\tMedical, dental, & vision insurance\n\tLife insurance and disability benefits\n\tFitness discounts\n\t401K\n\tFlexible Spending Accounts\n\tApple equipment\n\tCommuter subsidies\n\tCommunity involvement (4 hours per month to give back to the community)\n\tCompany sponsored tech talks and happy hours\n\tBreakfast, lunch, and dinner\n\tMuch more...\n\n\nOffices:\n\nAirbnb has Engineering offices along the West Coast in the U.S. and our teams are growing quickly!

It uniquely enables our hosts to be responsive even while on the go and enhances the travel experience of our guests by giving them highly relevant information when they need it. We believe that a clean, simple and easy to use interface is essential to achieving an optimal user experience. It is no surprise our apps have been featured in the Google Play Store, the iOS App Store and WWDC. \n\nLike all teams at Airbnb, we value and promote the diversity of our workforce, our guests, our hosts, our marketplace platform, and the world. Simply put, diversity belongs.\n\nWhat is iOS at Airbnb?\n\niOS at Airbnb is one of the main platforms that millions of users engage with daily. You would be helping build a critical part of the future success at Airbnb. Specifically we are looking for engineers who want to own large scope and drive huge impact.\n\nIf you are interested in product development - we’re looking for product-aware engineers who are thoughtful, responsible, and passionate individuals who appreciate user experience. We’re looking for someone who is not only well-versed in iOS development, but also has a strong understanding of good UX and enjoys working closely with design.\n\nIf you are interested in more mobile infrastructure - we’re looking for individuals who are thoughtful, responsible, passionate and appreciate infrastructure advancements. We’re looking for someone who has a strong understanding of mobile architectural patterns and is excited to learn about and contribute to that at scale.\n\nProjects:\n\n\n\tHomes 360 - Airbnb Plus is where high quality meets design personality. Every Plus home is verified to meet our bar. In the Plus 360 project, we want to build tools for hosts to submit a robust package of structured images, videos, 360 photos, and text about their home. Using this info, we can remotely evaluate whether the home meets our criteria. This will allow us to improve host experience and scale. Plus 360 requires capturing and submitting media. Having well designed and performant native apps are essential in accomplishing this. \n\tPlus HQ - We verify homes for quality, comfort, and style. The vetting process is complicated and requires much back and forth with the host. In Plus HQ projects, we are building a go-to place for our hosts to view their onboarding status, action items, next steps. This would enable us to provide them with educational content and help them throughout the process. When they become Plus hosts, they can use Plus HQ to see their performance and earnings.\n\n\n\n \n\n\tField workforce app - We are working on different ways to make our operations more scalable and efficient. We believe building an app that allows inspectors and photographers to manage their calendar availability, accept incoming requests, view appointment details, and perform home verification tasks, can make them much more efficient.\n\n\n \n\n\tIntelligent image loading - How would image sizes impact performance and business metrics? At Plus, we care about both online and offline product quality. Therefore, we want to measure image views at runtime and request the parameterized URL to fit the view exactly. This way we can use high-quality listing photos without negatively impacting our users with low bandwidth or small devices. \n\tAccessibility - Airbnb’s mission is to create a world where anyone can belong anywhere. With this in mind, iOS engineers worked tirelessly to ensure the entire experience is accessible for everyone. We were able to achieve this by recruiting advocates, rallying the Airbnb iOS community, holding in house training for engineers and designers, accumulating a knowledge repository from scratch, and most importantly, building the momentum and transforming the culture to prioritize building features with Accessibility from the onset of a project.\n\n\nMinimum Requirements:\n\n\t2+ years industry experience\n\tBachelor’s and/or Master’s degree, preferably in CS, or equivalent experience\n\tExperience shipping one or more Swift or Objective-C iOS apps, ideally currently available in the App Store.\n\tPersonal projects that show an aptitude for technical excellence and product sense.\n\tAbility to work in areas outside of your usual comfort zone and show motivation for personal growth.\n\tInterest in innovations within the mobile industry.\n\n\nRelevant Links:\n\n\tAirbnb Mobile Tech Talk recorded at Airbnb HQ\n\tTechCrunch - Airbnb makes checking in easier\n\tTechCrunch - Airbnb rolls out an apple watch app\n\tTechCrunch - Airbnb launches Apple TV app\n\tTechCrunch - Airbnb launches tablet friendly version\n\tWall Street Journal: With an IPO planned, the company seeks to broaden its appeal beyond home rentals\n\n\nBenefits:\n\n\tStock\n\tCompetitive salaries\n\tQuarterly employee travel coupon\n\tPaid time off\n\tMedical, dental, & vision insurance\n\tLife insurance and disability benefits\n\tFitness discounts\n\t401K\n\tFlexible Spending Accounts\n\tApple equipment\n\tCommuter subsidies\n\tCommunity involvement (4 hours per month to give back to the community)\n\tCompany sponsored tech talks and happy hours\n\tBreakfast, lunch, and dinner\n\tMuch more...\n\n\nOffices:\n\nAirbnb has Engineering offices along the West Coast in the U.S. and our teams are growing quickly!

Our discussions are focused around impact and doing right by our customers in the both the short term (next day) and long term (next year). \n\tPhotos: We’re collecting and processing an enormous amount of labeled photo data that is currently being manually assessed. We have started working towards building machine learning models that can help us assess photo quality and aim to do even more. \n\tValue to hosts: We’re constantly thinking of how to surface useful information to hosts to help them understand and maximize the value of being a Plus host. This consists of personalizing content and building applications that allow us contact house through various mediums. \n\tScaling our infrastructure: Plus is still in its early stages and we anticipate needing to scale.

With over 100M nights booked per year and counting, we're constantly tackling challenges in search algorithms, payments, fraud prevention, and growth — all while maintaining a beautiful user experience. To support the rapid growth in our business, we've also rapidly grown our engineering team. \n\nLike all teams at Airbnb, we value and promote the diversity of our workforce, our guests, our hosts, our marketplace platform, and the world. Simply put, diversity belongs\n\nWhat is Payments at Airbnb? \n\nAirbnb is a trusted marketplace and travel community. This level of trust is critical to the success of AIrbnb and has to extend to each payment experience. Payments enables trust and is a core and strategic part of Airbnb fueling growth with easy to use payment services. We are building a world-class payments platform that moves billions of dollars, in 191 countries, with 75 currencies, through a complex ecosystem of payments partners. We build and maintain our own in-house global payments platform because no solution exists with the global reach needed. As the platform grows we’ll be adding new payment partners, global licenses, and building new payment experiences for our guests and hosts.\n\nMeet the people, learn about the challenges, and read more about what we do at Payments here.\n\nThe Role\n\nAs an engineer on the Payments Product Platform, you will have the opportunity to work on products for our hosts, our guests, and our developers.\n\nOur hosts are the center of our community, and yet, many of their business needs remain unaddressed. Airbnb hosts don’t view themselves as hobbyists; they consider themselves as micro-entrepreneurs. Hosts crave for the tools and products that are available for small business owners. They want to understand not only how they’re doing financially today, but also how they might do in the future. They want to be able to understand their income through interactive dashboards, project their earning potential into the future, determine their profitability over time, and ensure that they are complying with all local laws including paying their taxes. To be successful, we want our hosts to focus on hospitality, while knowing that they are running a sustainable and successful business.\n\nWe also strive to provide a frictionless payment experience for our guests. This would include integrating with local payments providers, like Credit Card providers, PayPal, Alipay, WeChat, Boleto. It also includes allowing guest to have flexibility in their payments, both in terms of when and how they pay. We enable deposit payments, installment payments, paying with coupons and gift cards.\n\nFinally, we also are in the process of converting our payments systems into an extensible platform, that businesses around the world can leverage. We’re building clearly defined service APIs, well designed web components, extensive documentation frameworks, interactive dashboards and finely tuned alerting systems to encapsulate the complexity of the payments world. We hope to enable any business to allow any two people in the world to exchange money through our platform.\n\nRegardless of which area is of interest to you, you'll have a significant opportunity to work across the stack, be it creating the front-end components or diving deep into our internal Payments services. There are significant technical challenges you'll have the opportunity to solve, and you'll also have the chance to work heavily with Product, Design, Business Development and Data Science to directly influence product direction and what we build. If you're interested in working on a product team with opportunity for infrastructure challenges, our team is a great place for you!\n\nProjects\n\nAs an engineer on the Payments Product Platform team, you will build infrastructure, tools and products that hosts, guests and developers need to succeed.

Simply put, diversity belongs.\n\nWhat is Payments at Airbnb? \n\nAirbnb is a trusted marketplace and travel community. This level of trust is critical to the success of AIrbnb and has to extend to each payment experience. Payments enables trust and is a core and strategic part of Airbnb fueling growth with easy to use payment services. We are building a world-class payments platform that moves billions of dollars, in 191 countries, with 75 currencies, through a complex ecosystem of payments partners. We build and maintain our own in-house global payments platform because no solution exists with the global reach needed. As the platform grows we’ll be adding new payment partners, global licenses, and building new payment experiences for our guests and hosts.\n\nMeet the people, learn about the challenges, and read more about what we do at Payments here.\n\nThe Role\n\nThe Payments Core team is tasked to develop one of the largest payments and commerce services to power all Airbnb products, including home reservation, plus reservation, experience booking, 3rd party restaurant booking, and many other internal and external products. Payments Core team is responsible for providing foundation services, including checkout, order management, price quote, payments instrument management, payments gateway, payments routing, store value and so on at 24x7 with 99.99% reliability. We’re continually integrating with new payments partners to expand our global footprints around the world , launching new services to support new business needs, and building rich data pipelines to power financial reporting, data science, risk, and online systems.\n\nProjects\n\n\tCurrently, no solution exists with the global reach Airbnb requires, so we build and maintain our own global payments infrastructure which becomes one of the largest payments solution in the world. Here is how we scaling payments platform and built such a large in-house payments operation. We’ll also take a look at some of the technology that has helped Airbnb scale to 191 countries, over 70 currencies, and a network of over two dozen payment routes.\n\tOur payments platform transmits billions of dollars per year in dozens of different currencies across almost every country in the world. Most of the time, our system functions without incident, but we do encounter some hiccups where a certain currency cannot be processed or a certain payment gateway is inaccessible. In order to catch these interruptions as quickly as possible, the Data Science team has built an anomaly detection system that can identify problems in real time as they develop.\n\tWe take security very seriously and work on a variety of security initiatives including data encryption and building and maintaining PCI compliant systems.\n\n\nMinimum Requirements\n\n\t2+ years of industry experience building large-scale backend systems\n\tSolid engineering and coding skills.

Traditional key-value stores and the current company wide solution doesn’t fully satisfy Payments’ infrastructural needs. Thus, the Payments team has to build all those infrastructure solutions for ourselves and Payments Foundation team is taking most challenges in this area. The team focuses on the following five areas to support the payments systems’ infrastructure for all other payments sub-teams: Performance, Availability, Load testing, Testability, and Operability. The team is a new team growing fast and has planned many exciting and challenging projects in 2018 and 2019. This team will allow you to take lots of hard core infrastructure challenges in the fintech world. \n\nProjects\n\n\tIn a distributed payment ecosystem, it is critical to accurately measure and track a transaction’s end to end state and contents to ensure consistency throughout the payment cycle. Without robust tracking, data leakage and errors can occur, resulting in either lost revenue or increased costs for all parties in the payment cycle, including the consumers, merchants, gateways, and acquirers. You can find how Airbnb is measuring transactional integrity.\n\tWe solve lots of interesting and technical challenging problems such as building state machine framework for idempotency, eventual consistency, sharding for scaling MySql databases and its failover solutions, reliable scheduling framework, reliable events framework, etc.\n\n\nMinimum Requirements\n\n\t2+ years of industry experience building large-scale backend systems\n\tSolid engineering and coding skills.

These services are engineered to run at scale with high reliability and low latency. These services are being architected to help onboard new home type such as boutique hotels.  Airbnb is currently in the process of transforming its infrastructure and services to service-oriented architecture (SOA). This means, that at the end of our re-architecture, we will have moved all of our functionality into cohesive services with loose coupling, resulting in increased agility, reliability and paving the path for performance optimizations.  We will be able to on-board and support new businesses on Airbnb quickly. Homes engineering teams work on architecting and leading Airbnb's transformation to SOA by working closely with both Product and Infrastructure Tools teams.

Within Homes engineering, you can have significant impact on a wide range of Airbnb products and users. Whether you are working on one of our big bets such as guest loyalty or personalization, improving our tools for guests and hosts around the world, or working on a new business such as Airbnb for Work or Airbnb Plus, you will be on a small team designed to maximize your ability to deliver results.  If you are motivated by how much visibility your work has, how much it impacts the company's bottom line, how many users see your work, or how it will impact your career growth, Homes is a great place to launch your Airbnb career.\n\nLike all teams at Airbnb, we value and promote the diversity of our workforce, our guests, our hosts, our marketplace platform, and the world. Simply put, diversity belongs.\n\n\n\nWhat is Frontend at Airbnb?\n\nFrontend Engineers are an essential part of Airbnb's Product Team. FEs work closely with world class product managers, designers, and data scientists. We rely and (and build on!) cutting edge tooling such as Apollo/GraphQL and deliver a strongly-typed UI using TypeScript. We build libraries and abstractions to make our lives easier, such as Design Language System (DLS), our front-end toolkit, which helps ensure our product looks and works great everywhere from a Cinema Display with a fiber connection down to a cheap phone with a shaky 3G connection.\n\n \n\nProjects:\n\n \n\n\tAirbnb Page Builder (aka Magic Doorway): Create, ship and update high performance, responsive, fully localized pages completely through a page builder UI. Never again spend time on boilerplate code or procrastinate on shipping minor content changes when you or your content/design/PM teammates can update pages on the fly. We're continuing to improvement the builder and component library so you'll always stay up to date with the latest designs, get user metrics out of the box, easily ship A:B tests, and more such as speed improvements to bring load times as close to zero as possible.\n\n\n\tHyperloop: Our new server rendering engine, Hyperloop, is ready to roll out, and Homes will have priority access. This is a killer opportunity to build greenfield apps on the frontend that complement our emerging SOA strategy on the backend. This means sitting next to some of the best designers in the world, feeling totally unconstrained by tooling, building world class product\n\n\n \n\n\tGraphQL and TypeScript (in progress): Rolling out GraphQL at Airbnb is a really exciting technical challenge to be a part of. We are moving to GraphQL while converting to TypeScript, which means end-to-end types from the backend all the way through our presentation components. We are collaborating actively with the Apollo team, allowing Frontend engineers to work at the absolute forefront of JavaScript work, everything from partial query caching, local device persistence, data mocking, and more! \n\n\tSee our recent Tech Talk and the blog post more details.\n\n\n\n\tBuilding for High Performance (in progress): Homes is leading the way at Airbnb, building a modern Frontend with portfolio of page load techniques, including service worker, the new \"Arrive\" framework (server render React but don't load React on the client!), client routing with innovative lazy loading strategies. We are right at the point where we have the core infrastructure in place but haven't solved the tricky and interesting product side of the coin. \n\n\n \n\nMinimum Requirements:\n\n\t2+ years industry experience\n\tBachelor’s and/or Master’s degree, preferably in CS, or equivalent experience\n\tComfortable coding in JavaScript\n\tExperience with modern JavaScript libraries and tooling (e.g. React)\n\tFluency in HTML, CSS, and related web technologies\n\tDemonstrated knowledge of Computer Science fundamentals\n\tAwareness of cross-browser compatibility issues and client-side performance considerations\n\tDemonstrated design and UX sensibilities\n\n\n \n\nAdditional requirements/responsibilities:\n\n\tDrive the future of Frontend products in the industry and create world class performance for all of Airbnb’s products \n\tCollaborate with Product Managers and Experience Designers to iterate on the design and implementation of our product\n\tWork with Data Scientists and Backend Engineers to build features and ship experiments\n\tBuild efficient and reusable front-end systems and abstractions\n\tFind and address performance issues\n\tParticipate in design and code reviews\n\tIdentify and communicate front-end best practices\n\n\n \n\nRelevant Links:\n\n\tRearchitecting Airbnb’s Frontend\n\tTechTalk: GraphQL and Appollo at Airbnb\n\tOperationalizing Node.js for Server Side Rendering\n\tReconciling GraphQL and Thrift at Airbnb\n\tMoving Airbnb Search to React\n\n\n \n\nBenefits:\n\n\tStock\n\tCompetitive salaries\n\tQuarterly employee travel coupon\n\tPaid time off\n\tMedical, dental, & vision insurance\n\tLife insurance and disability benefits\n\tFitness Discounts\n\t401K\n\tFlexible Spending Accounts\n\tApple equipment\n\tCommuter Subsidies\n\tCommunity Involvement (4 hours per month to give back to the community)\n\tCompany sponsored tech talks and happy hours\n\tMuch more… \n\n\n \n\nOffices: \n\nAirbnb has Engineering offices along the West Coast in the U.S. and our teams are growing quickly!

Additionally, these projects utilized various profiling tools to identify and solve performance problems including scroll performance, image caching, memory usage, and network latency.\n\tHost Management Tools - Built core flows for the millions of Airbnb hosts who use the app every day to manage their listings. We recently added a “Progress” tab in the Android app which allows hosts to see their earnings, views and bookings, and track their progress towards becoming a Superhost and the collections their listings might be eligible for.\n\tAdded support for Airbnb Plus - Airbnb Plus is a new selection of the highest quality homes with hosts known for great reviews and attention to detail. This involved modifying the search experience to introduce the new tier of listings and building and optimizing a completely customized product details screen.\n\tIntelligent image loading - Dynamically measure image views at runtime and request the parameterized url to fit the view exactly. Support low bandwidth mode by scaling down image sizes based on network conditions. Build support into Epoxy for image prefetching in lists of images. Develop tools to support smooth shared element image transitions between screens.\n\tScreenshot testing - Leveraged our MvRx architecture to easily mock out data for each screen and take screenshots on CI. Use the Happo service to compare screenshots across changes and detect regressions.\n\tAccessibility - Airbnb’s mission is to create a world where anyone can belong anywhere. With this in mind, Android engineers worked tirelessly to ensure the entire experience is accessible for everyone. We were able to achieve this by recruiting advocates, rallying the Airbnb Android community, holding in house training for engineers and designers, accumulating a knowledge repository from scratch, and most importantly, building the momentum and transforming the culture to prioritize building features with Accessibility from the onset of a project.\n\n\nMinimum Requirements:\n\n\t2+ years industry experience\n\tBachelor’s and/or Master’s degree, preferably in CS, or equivalent experience\n\tExperience shipping one or more Android apps, ideally currently available in the Google Play Store\n\tProficiency in Java or Kotlin and knowledge of the Android SDK and open-source Android ecosystem\n\tPersonal projects that show an aptitude for technical excellence or product sense\n\tAdvanced analytical thinking; experienced with making product decisions based on data and A/B testing\n\tInterest in innovations within the mobile industry\n\n\nRelevant Links:\n\n\tAirbnb Mobile Tech Talk recorded at Airbnb HQ\n\tTechCrunch - Airbnb makes checking in easier\n\tEpoxy - Epoxy is an Android library for building complex screens in a RecyclerView\n\tMvRx - Kotlin based framework that makes Android screens, from the simplest to the most complex, significantly easier to develop and maintain.

No company has succeeded in putting inventory, content and planning tools for travel in one cohesive product experience. Trip Platform intends to help Airbnb capture a huge amount of the travel booking market by achieving this goal.\n\nIn addition, the team’s goal is to remove as much unnecessary effort as possible from the internal businesses, so they can focus on making their unique product great. We want to make it easy for new and established businesses within Airbnb to plug into the larger trip booking ecosystem. This gives a business within Airbnb an immense head-start on any startup or other company because they get a huge amount of the required product for free.\n\n Like all teams at Airbnb, we value and promote the diversity of our workforce, our guests, our hosts, our marketplace platform, and the world.

With over 100M nights booked per year and counting, we're constantly tackling challenges in search algorithms, payments, fraud prevention, and growth — all while maintaining a beautiful user experience. To support the rapid growth in our business, we've also rapidly grown our engineering team. \n\nWhat is the Support Products (SuP) team at Airbnb?\n\nThe Support Products team ensures that the people using Airbnb are well taken care of when a part of their experience does not go according to plan. Our goal is to get people’s problems solved as quickly and satisfactorily as  possible, whether via self-solve, or by routing you to the best possible agent and giving that agent the tools to resolve your issue. When something goes wrong, a fast and fair resolution can make the difference between whether you’ll book with Airbnb again. Being efficient here is not only good for customers, it can also make the difference between whether our business is profitable.\n\nWhat is a Generalist at Airbnb?\n\nGeneralist engineers at Airbnb operate at all levels, including core services, data pipelines, essential business systems, and customer-facing features.  We’re responsible for a range of product surfaces across Host and Guest experiences in the dynamic marketplace, and the initiatives we drive span across foundational core infrastructure to rapid feature iteration. Generalist engineers play an impactful role on all sub-teams within Support Products.\n\nSuP Subteams:\n\nVoice & Data: 60% of Airbnb guests and hosts reach us by phone. These are the hardest types of contacts to handle because we can’t easily ask triage questions. The voice team is responsible for handling these contacts in the most efficient manner possible.\n\nAgent Tools: The Agent Tools team builds the core tools serving Airbnb’s thousands of CX Agents and Partners. Agents spend their days living in the tools we create, viewing user data, managing support tickets, and executing workflows. Our tools not only impact the joy of Agents, but also ultimately serve to improve Airbnb’s customers’ experience by enabling Agents to solve user issues faster and more effectively. \n\nAgent Intelligence: SuP Agent Intelligence team provides the best practice and knowledge to our internal agents through tools. We collect and analyze the data from agents' behavior, then recommend the most efficient way to solve the customer issues. We aim to surface the right information at the right time, and ensure the customers are treated the right way.

The team builds and maintains a bunch of services on top of AWS hardware and software for the whole company, such as databases, caches, streaming and queueing systems, and monitoring tools. The team also provides architecture design reviews, in-depth performance profiling, and builds accessible tools for engineers to identify the bottlenecks and interactions within various systems. Recently, the team is experimenting Kubernetes in order to achieve better scalability and resilience.\n\nTwo forever challenges for Airbnb infrastructure and the team are:\n\n\tScalability: As a high-growth company, we have seen huge growth of traffic in the past years. For example, our Kafka traffic grows by 6x in the past year. In order to support such growth, Cloud Infrastructure team needs to continuously improve existing systems and explore next-generation infrastructure. To take database as an example, we went through several phases to handle data growth: upgrade software and hardware, split database, migrate to AWS Aurora, develop Airbnb-internal data access layer between applications and storage engines.\n\tStability: System stability as well as availability are among the most important metrics for the company. In order to achieve high stability, the team takes multiple efforts in parallel: (1) Each service/system improves its own stability; (2) Introspect end-to-end workflow to identify fragile components and fix them; (3) Build data backup and recovery mechanisms.\n\n\nWhat are examples of work that Cloud Infrastructure engineers have done at Airbnb?\n\nHere are some examples of work from Cloud infrastructure team. Note that some of the works are on top of industry-popular open source projects or AWS services.\n\n\tBuild and maintain scalable and reliable databases/caches services to serve the whole company. \n\tBuild multiple queueing systems (such as Kafka, Kinesis, AWS SQS and Resque) to serve various business need. We scale our Kafka clusters to handle 6x traffic growth in a year.\n\tIntroduce Kubernetes to the company and grow Kubernetes clusters by 10x in the last year. We are preparing the clusters to onboard hundreds of services.\n\tDevelop disaster recovery mechanism to protect Airbnb data in case of disasters and emergencies.\n\tBuild Java and Ruby profiling tools to allow engineers to efficiently identify system bottlenecks. Also build monitoring and introspection tools to allow engineers to quickly introspect a system.\n\tBuild service mesh architecture to allow traffic routing and load balancing among hundreds of services.\n\tDefine SOA architecture for all Airbnb products and help them move towards the goal.\n\n\nCloud Infrastructure at Airbnb online:\n\n\tAirbnb Engineering Blog\n\n\tBuilding Services at Airbnb: Part 1 and Part 2\n\tCapturing Data Evolution in a Service-Oriented Architecture\n\tNebula as a Storage Platform to Build Airbnb’s Search Backends\n\n\n\tTech talk on migrating to Aurora at AWS re:Invent 2017\n\tGithub\n\n\tSpinalTap: a general-purpose reliable Change Data Capture (CDC) service\n\tSparsam: fast thrift bindings for Ruby \n\tSynapse and Nerve: a service discovery framework \n\n\n\nWhat experience is relevant to us?\n\nRequirements\n\n\tBS/MS/PhD in Computer Science or a related field\n\tExceptional proficiency using Java. Experience with Ruby/Ruby on Rails is a plus.\n\tProactiveness, good communication and fast learning, highly independent and autonomous.\n\tAbility to work in areas outside of your usual comfort zone and show motivation for personal growth.\n\n\nPreferred Qualifications\n\n\tExperience with Kubernetes and Docker\n\tDesign or operation of robust distributed systems\n\tExperience with AWS cloud infrastructure\n\n\nWhat benefits do we have?\n\n\tStock\n\tCompetitive salaries\n\tQuarterly employee travel coupon\n\tPaid time off\n\tMedical, dental, & vision insurance\n\tLife insurance and disability benefits\n\tFitness discounts\n\t401K\n\tFlexible Spending Accounts\n\tApple equipment\n\tCommuter subsidies\n\tCommunity involvement (4 paid hours per month for community service)\n\tCompany-sponsored tech talks and happy hours\n\tMuch more...\n\n\n\n          \n            Apply Now\n          \n        \n\n      \n\n      \n        \n          \t\n                Tweet\n              \n\t\n              \n            \n\t\n                \n\n              \n\t\n                \n\n              \n\n\n        \n\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n          \n\tTerms\n\tPrivacy\n\tSite Map\n\tAirbnbmag"

Our engineering teams see big challenges as opportunities to craft beautiful and scalable solutions that inspire technical innovation, both in our company and in the tech and travel industries as a whole. We’ve already booked upwards of ten million nights and empowered millions of guests and hosts to reimagine what it means to belong anywhere. There is still so much more that we want to build from scratch and improve! We are looking for passionate, technically agile new grads who want to be part of a company that’s pioneering a new kind of global community.\n\nWhat will my experience be like as a New Grad in the Portland office?\n\nWe are excited to welcome 3-4 New Grads to our growing team of 30 engineers in Portland. New Grads will spend their first two weeks in SF where you will attend Airbnb Bootcamp before you officially begin in Portland. You will then be given the opportunity to take on a range of projects that you are passionate about. Our teams move fast and engineers find projects that motivate them as well as receive mentorship from those around them. By being a pioneer New Grad in this office, your growth trajectory will grow as the office grows.\n\nThe following experience is relevant to us:\n\n\tBS and/or MS degree in computer science, math or a related technical field\n\tExperience using Python, Java, Scala, Ruby and/or Ruby on Rails\n\tExperience using C++, and SQL for the backend (project dependent)\n\tExperience using HTML/CSS, and Javascript for the frontend (project dependent)\n\n\nBenefits\n\n\tStock\n\tCompetitive salaries\n\tPaid time off\n\tMedical, dental, & vision insurance\n\tLife insurance and disability benefits\n\t401K\n\tFlexible Spending Accounts\n\tApple equipment\n\tCompany sponsored tech talks and happy hours\n\tBreakfast, lunch, and dinner\n\tQuarterly employee travel coupon\n\tMuch more...\n\n\nWhy Portland?\n\nOne of the most unique aspects of Airbnb’s business is the complexity and significance of our customer support operation. The nature of an international home sharing business gives rise to a variety of multi-party issues and cross-cultural considerations. And the stakes are high: our host community opens their doors to strangers every day, and having solid customer support is a huge part of earning their trust in doing so. Guests are often on vacation or business travel; because of that, they may need our support in critical moments of vulnerability or transformation.\n\nAs members of the Supports Product team in the Portland office, we are in constant contact with our users: we share an office with hundreds of our best customer support agents and leaders whose insights are invaluable to our work in building the tools they use to support the community. We even have an “incubation team” of support agents who sit immediately adjacent to our engineers, designers, and product experts for even tighter feedback loops. Our broader customer support team is located around the globe, so there are plenty of opportunities for international travel if that’s your thing.\n\nAirbnb’s Portland office is located in two historic buildings overlooking the Willamette river. Portland is home to over 380 employees who have a primary focus of supporting our users and gaining their trust. Our office has high ceilings, plenty of space, and lots of light. There are couch areas and plenty of other nooks and crannies though, when you need more focus and solitude. The atmosphere is casual, and schedules are flexible. We love biking and bringing our dogs to work.\n\n \n\n#LI-DNI\n\n\n          \n            Apply Now\n          \n        \n\n      \n\n      \n        \n          \t\n                Tweet\n              \n\t\n              \n            \n\t\n                \n\n              \n\t\n                \n\n              \n\n\n        \n\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n          \n\tTerms\n\tPrivacy\n\tSite Map\n\tAirbnbmag"

We own everything related to operationalizing Airbnb to keep it running as a marketplace.\n\nWe recently kicked off a new initiative of distributed engineering teams at Airbnb. There is much more that we want to build and so much that we could improve. We value strong engineers who are agile enough to jump into projects across all areas of the stack: Backend, Machine Learning, and Full Stack.\n\nOur product feedback loop is immediate which means we can rapidly iterate and deploy.  If you enjoy building full stack applications from the ground up, leveraging the newest technologies to delight users, and executing like an entrepreneur, then you’ve found the right place.\n\nInspiration starts from within: the same love and thought that goes into building customer facing product goes into our employee facing product. The team takes on the unique opportunity of interfacing directly with stakeholders around the company to build full stack applications with an array of technologies. In fact, our team codes with some of the newest and most diverse set of technologies within Airbnb.\n\nWhat are examples of work that Software Engineers have done at Airbnb?\n\n\tWe own the application that hundreds of Customer Experience agents use to triage and solve issues at scale.\n\tOur payments platform transmits billions of dollars in dozens of different currencies among over 100 countries. By integrating new partners, we can both optimize our costs and grow our business by better supporting different countries.\n\tWe re-built the List Your Space flow. We A/B tested every change carefully and within three months doubled the conversion rate.\n\tWe created Neighborhoods, a product that answers the question of which parts of a city have desirable Airbnb listings for you. We built systems that allowed writers, translators, and photographers all over the world to collaborate on bringing cities to life. Read more.\n\tWhen Hurricane Sandy struck, we partnered with the City of New York to quickly create a platform for New Yorkers to provide free housing to those who were displaced by the storm.\n\n\nThe following are some examples of profiles that are relevant to us:\n\n\tMinimum 2 years of industry experience in software engineering.\n\tWork experience, open-source code (e.g., GitHub), or coursework in any of the following languages: C/C++, Java, JavaScript, Python/Django, Ruby/Ruby on Rails\n\tEvidence of exposure to architectural patterns of a large, high-scale web application (e.g., well-designed APIs, high volume data pipelines, efficient algorithms).\n\tEngineers who have experience with web best practices such as A/B testing, test coverage\n\n\nSeattle Engineering Positions:\n\n\tAs an engineer on the Seattle team, you'll be expected to move across all areas of the stack.\n\tBackend Engineers\n\n\tWe are responsible for the architecture, development and scaling of backend systems that power Airbnb. Our goals include scaling and architecting systems to support advanced product features that may not be currently viable because of hard technical considerations. System uptime and availability are a priority for the team.\n\n\n\tMachine Learning Engineers\n\n\tWe own challenging data problems related to auto-detecting user issues, intelligent routing, real-time optimization across multiple contact channels, and more. We build machine learning infrastructure and models in collaboration with data scientists to build software that can solve problems better and faster than humans. Note that this role will not be a pure Machine Learning role, and you'll still be expected to contribute on either the backend or other parts of the stack.\n\n\n\tFull Stack Engineers\n\n\tWe operate at all levels of the stack: we’re responsible for the UIs that thousands of CX agents use daily, the APIs and vendor integrations to process tickets and channel communications, the reporting pipelines to ensure data integrity and allow teams to operate, and more.\n\n\n\nBenefits\n\n\tStock\n\tCompetitive salaries\n\tQuarterly employee travel coupon\n\tPaid time off\n\tMedical, dental, & vision insurance\n\tLife insurance and disability benefits\n\tFitness Discounts\n\t401K\n\tFlexible Spending Accounts\n\tApple equipment\n\tCommuter Subsidies\n\tCommunity Involvement (4 hours per month to give back to the community)\n\tCompany sponsored tech talks and happy hours\n\tMuch more...\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n            Apply Now\n          \n        \n\n      \n\n      \n        \n          \t\n                Tweet\n              \n\t\n              \n            \n\t\n                \n\n              \n\t\n                \n\n              \n\n\n        \n\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n          \n\tTerms\n\tPrivacy\n\tSite Map\n\tAirbnbmag"

Thank you. \n\nAirbnb has become a global platform that connects travelers and hosts from over 34,000 cities. As such, experimentation is core to our growing business. We want to take a scientific approach to decision-making through careful hypothesis generation and testing and drive actions/refine strategies through insights from experimental analysis. \n\nOur inference data scientists are deep in understanding the complications of running experiments in a two-sided marketplace, power analysis and stopping criterions, and statistical models to improve power/significance. Another interesting problem space is understanding what to do when we are unable to conduct experiments. How do we understand the impact of something new?\n\n \n\nWe are looking for experienced Data Scientists to join our team and expand upon the work we have done. Here are some examples of projects we currently need help with:\n\n\tDevelop experiments to reduce friction in the listing creation process for hosts\n\tDesigning experiments to measure the lift when displaying hotel rooms on our platform\n\tCreate product experiments (on service fees, early demand, etc) and measure the impact on market dynamics (such as competitors).\n\tImprove the statistical methodology behind our experimentation platform to ensure that our understanding of product changes is rigorous and accurate\n\n\n \n\nTo learn more, read about our Inference data science work:\n\n\t4 Principles for Making Experimentation Count \n\tScaling Airbnb's Experimentation Platform\n\n\n\nWe have a strong team of Data Scientists, our work is highly sought-after, and our impact on the business is tremendous. If you have a proven background in this field and are excited to help build Airbnb’s community, we want to hear from you.\n\n\nSome examples of traits we value:\n\n\tA passion for Airbnb’s mission of helping people Belong Anywhere\n\tAbility to write clean and concise code, especially in R or Python\n\t3+ years in industry experience and a Master's degree in a quantitative field or Economics; PhD is a plus\n\tSolid understanding of statistics\n\tKeen eye for detail and thoughtful investigation of data before relying upon it\n\tIntuition for data science best practices, stemming from proven experience\n\tSteadfast focus on creating impactful change\n\tAbility to partner with cross-functional teams using strong written and verbal communication \n\n\n\n          \n            Apply Now\n          \n        \n\n      \n\n      \n        \n          \t\n                Tweet\n              \n\t\n              \n            \n\t\n                \n\n              \n\t\n                \n\n              \n\n\n        \n\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n          \n\tTerms\n\tPrivacy\n\tSite Map\n\tAirbnbmag"

The Build Infrastructure (BuildInfra) team at Airbnb develops, deploys, and maintains the software that every Airbnb developer uses to build services and shared libraries. BuildInfra is part of our larger Developer Infrastructure team.\n\nAs Airbnb's business and engineering team have grown, we have adopted a microservices architecture. We write most of our microservices in Java. The source code for all of these services, and the internal libraries they share, lives in a monorepository called Treehouse. Treehouse has 2M lines of code, and hundreds of developers triggering thousands of builds per day; we expect Treehouse to grow by a factor of 5x in the next two years. Our BuildInfra team uses state of the art techniques, such as distributed builds and shared artifact caches, to ensure incremental and full builds are as fast as possible.\n\nOur team is impactful and high-leverage: we make the entire engineering organization more productive. You will have visibility into every other engineering team and their systems, and you'll engage in helping and mentoring them.\n\n \n\nWhat will you do on buildinfra at Airbnb?\n\n\tBring joy to ~1000 developers every day!\n\tContribute to our in-house CI/CD system,* the largest distributed system at Airbnb\n\tCollaborate with our customers (other Airbnb developers) to understand their needs and ensure our team focuses on the highest-impact problems\n\tWrite tools to provide fast, stable builds across our entire tech stack\n\tWrite tools to enable developers to easily manage internal and external dependencies\n\tOpen source your work, describe it in blog posts, and talk about it at conferences\n\n\nWhat have we done in the past?\n\n\tWe added support for mixed-language (ObjC / Swift) iOS development to Buck, which is now in Buck core\n\tWe used the latest features in Gradle to enable fast monorepo Java builds (our usage of Gradle's remote build cache was cited during the keynote of Gradle Summit 2017)\n\tEvidence of exposure to architectural patterns of a large, high-scale web application (e.g., well-designed APIs, high volume data pipelines, efficient algorithms).\n\tEngineers who have experience with web best practices such as A/B testing, test coverage\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\tYou are passionate about automation, efficiency, and developer happiness!\n\tYou have 3+ years of full-time, industry experience\n\tYou love build tools (Gradle, Maven, sbt, Grunt, Gulp, Bazel, Buck, Xcode)\n\tYou have experience using JVM-based languages (Java, Groovy, Kotlin)\n\tYou are familiar with cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCE, Azure, Kubernetes, Docker)\n\n\nBenefits\n\n\tStock\n\tCompetitive salaries\n\tQuarterly employee travel coupon\n\tPaid time off\n\tMedical, dental, & vision insurance\n\tLife insurance and disability benefits\n\tFitness Discounts\n\t401K\n\tFlexible Spending Accounts\n\tApple equipment\n\tCommuter Subsidies\n\tCommunity Involvement (4 hours per month to give back to the community)\n\tCompany sponsored tech talks and happy hours\n\tMuch more...\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n            Apply Now\n          \n        \n\n      \n\n      \n        \n          \t\n                Tweet\n              \n\t\n              \n            \n\t\n                \n\n              \n\t\n                \n\n              \n\n\n        \n\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n          \n\tTerms\n\tPrivacy\n\tSite Map\n\tAirbnbmag"
